                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">I am deeply honored that Gangneung has been selected to host the 2026 ITS World Congress.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">As major cities worldwide handle issues such as population density, environmental pollution, and traffic congestion, small and medium-sized cities face challenges such as insufficient infrastructure, population decline, and regional extinction.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">Gangneung aims to solve these issues and propose a sustainable development model by establishing a smart city platform and mobility innovation.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">Through the 2026 Gangneung ITS World Congress, Gangneung aims to showcase its unique mobility technologies to participants from around the world, offering solutions to various urban issues.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">Under the theme "Beyond Mobility Connected World," the congress will include ministerial meetings, academic conferences, exhibitions, technology demonstrations, as well as diverse programs such as a coffee festival, cultural heritage tours, and K-culture performances for everyone to enjoy.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">We hope that the Gangneung ITS World Congress will serve as a platform for global experts in the ITS field to share knowledge and technology, and for policymakers to discuss the future vision of ITS. We anticipate that this event will provide significant opportunities in the ITS industry and businesses.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">Beyond the congress, Gangneung, with its beautiful natural environment, rich history, unique traditions, and distinct culture, aims to offer a special experience as a representative tourist city of South Korea.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">Building on the success of hosting the 2018 Winter Olympics and the strength of our citizens, Gangneung is committed to making the 2026 ITS World Congress a success. We strive to establish Gangneung as a global model for ITS in small and medium-sized cities.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">We sincerely ask for your interest and participation in the 2026 Gangneung ITS World Congress.</p>

                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">Recently, Korea has been facing complex societal issues such as transportation and environmental problems due to the concentration of social and economic activities in major metropolitan areas like Seoul. Conversely, smaller cities are experiencing challenges such as population decline, aging population, and decreased economic activities.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">To address these changes in smaller cities, it is crucial in the field of transportation to develop sustainable future transportation strategies, establish customized ITS systems, and provide new transportation services to foster urban growths. Gangneung, as one of Korea's leading tourist cities with the successful hosting of the 2018 Winter Olympics, is well-equipped to prepare for the 2026 ITS World Congress. Gangneung is devoted to present a vision for the role of ITS in the growth and development of medium-sized cities.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">Furthermore, Gangneung envisions creating a future mobility city unique to smaller cities, showcasing “Connected World Beyond Mobility”. The 2026 Gangneung ITS World Congress, scheduled from October 19th to 23rd, anticipates significant attendance from around 90 countries.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">This Congress, not only in scale but also in content, promises to be richer than ever. With diverse programs including academic sessions, exhibitions, and business consultations, it will serve as a platform for showcasing cutting-edge technologies, sharing knowledge. Visitors will be able to experience "Mobility Services Anytime, Anywhere, for Anyone" pursued by Korean smaller cities.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">Gangneung is diligently preparing for the 32nd ITS World Congress to ensure the highest level of readiness and to achieve substantial success.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">As the World Congress Board of Directors of Republic of Korea, I would like to invite all of you to join us at the 32nd ITS World Congress in Gangneung.</p>

                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">The ITS World Congress, also known as the 'Olympics of Transportation', is the world's largest exhibition and academic conference in the field of ITS. It originated in Paris, France, in 1994 and has been held annually, rotating through Asia, the Americas, and Europe, providing a platform for experts to convene, share knowledge on ITS policies and technology, and acquire the latest information.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">After hosting the 5th Seoul ITS World Congress in 1998 and the 17th Busan ITS World Congress in 2010, Korea is honored to host the 32nd ITS World Congress in Gangneung in 2026.</p>
                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">Unlike previous congresses that primarily addressed one-dimensional traffic congestion issues in major cities, Gangneung aims to showcase a new paradigm of sustainable development tailored to the characteristics of a representative small-to-medium-sized tourism city in Korea. Under the theme 'Beyond Mobility Connected World,' we aspire to offer opportunities to experience new ITS services, various project sites, and the harmony of traditional and modern aspects of Korea, as well as the charm of our city.</p>

                                            <p class="greet_tail_para">We look forward to the participation of many individuals in the 32nd Gangneung ITS World Congress, scheduled from October 19th to 23rd, 2026.
